# JavaScript Group Project Guidelines

## AIMS/PURPOSE:

- To gain experience working in a team with other developers, and to understand some of the challenges this creates and ways to overcome these.

- To have the opportunity to try using agile practices.

- To become more confident using Git/GitHub for a multi person project.

- To consolidate learning from the JavaScript module and have the opportunity to try some new things, the project is not focused on making an exciting end product, more on the process and teamwork.

- To create a project using core Javascript. This means **no** frameworks or jQuery are allowed. Only use the tools/packages we have used in class

- Ask an instructor about additional tools .

- One person should create a project, then add the rest of the team as collaborators.
